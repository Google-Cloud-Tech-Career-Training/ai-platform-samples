Before submitting a Jupyter notebook, follow this mandatory checklist:

- [ ] Use the [notebook template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-platform-samples/blob/master/ai-platform-unified/notebooks/notebook_template.ipynb) as a starting point.
- [ ] Follow the style and grammar rules outlined in the above notebook template.
- [ ] Verify the notebook runs successfully in Colab since the automated tests cannot guarantee this even when it passes.
- [ ] Passes all the required automated checks
