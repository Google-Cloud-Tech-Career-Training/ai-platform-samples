Before submitting a Jupyter notebook, follow this mandatory checklist:

- [ ] Use the [notebook template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-platform-samples/blob/master/ai-platform-unified/notebooks/notebook_template.ipynb) as a starting point.
- [ ] Follow the style and grammar rules outlined in the above notebook template.
- [ ] Verify the notebook runs successfully in Colab since the automated tests cannot guarantee this even when it passes.
- [ ] Passes all the required automated checks
- [ ] Has been reviewed by a Tech Writer
- [ ] This notebook has been added to the CODEOWNERS file, pointing to the author or the author's team. If the CODEOWNERS file doesn't exist, create one in the nearest folder that makes sense.
